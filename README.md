 ## Acknoledgement
 I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my trainers, [`Cyril Castagnet`](https://github.com/lecascyril) and [`Ben BK`](https://github.com/BenBktech), at Alyra. Your expertise, guidance, and support throughout the courses were instrumental in my learning journey. 

 I also want to extend my thanks to the entire Alyra team for creating such an enriching and supportive learning environment. The guest speakers who shared their insights, and experiences during the program added depth to our understanding. 
 
 Finally, to my project team members, Benoist, Virginie, and Peter, your collaboration, creativity, and hard work made our project a success. 
 
 Thank you all for your contributions to my growth and development in the web3 environment.
